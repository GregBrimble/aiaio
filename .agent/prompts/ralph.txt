1. Find the highest-priority task and implement it. When choosing the next task, prioritize in this order:
	a) Architectural decisions and core abstractions
	b) Integration points between modules
	c) Unknown unknowns and spike work
	d) Standard features and implementation
	e) Polish, cleanup, and quick wins
	Fail fast on risky work. Save easy wins for later.
2. Run 'npm run check'.
3. Update prd.json with what was done.
4. Append your progress to progress.txt:
	- Task completed and PRD item reference
	- Key decisions made and reasoning
	- Files changed
	- Any blockers or notes for next iteration
	Keep entries concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision. This file helps future iterations skip exploration.
5. Commit your changes.
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
